## Description:
"To the Stars!" is a 2D platformer where the player dodges obstacles to reach the goal at the top of the stage. The game uses Python's Pygame extension and is played in a square window. The game uses pixel art assets and a sprite of "Hoshimachi Suisei' from Hololive, which serves as the inspiration for the game. 

Underneath the hood, the game works by creating a grid of data. In each node of the grid, a number between 0-4 can be put and depending on the number, a certain object is placed. 1-2 serves as some sort of platfor, 3-4 serves as some sort of obstacle. The game uses Pygame's functions of collision and image rendering in order to handle collision, deaths, UI, etc. All additional files in the repository are merely there as pictures for the assets used.

In the future, I would go back and fix the base character controller in order to implement a smoother move set and jumping mechanic. I'd also add additional levels as this goal was out of the scope of the project.
