## Project Description
2D sidescrolling platforming game with simple art style. Will have one or two levels and menus. 

## Features
-Menus & UI: Will use pygame's image functions and use true/false logic on when screens appear.
-Level Map - Use of matrixes to draw level maps/define where objects shall be.
-Player & Enemies - Use of classes to store information and states about non-static factors.

## Challenges
The major challenge only present is researching further in Pygame documentation and struggling with any issues/misunderstandings that arise.

## Outcomes
The ideal outcome would be I have a platformer that has a playable character, enemies, collision, and some sort of UI element(s). At minimum, I need a platformer with a player that interacts with collision in a non-problematic way (i.e. falling through the floor,
clipping through the floor, etc.)

## Incoming Milestones
Week 1 - Have a map w/ collision and a playable character by end of week.
Week 2 - Have enemies and fix any remaining bugs/issues.
Week 3 - Have menu and UI elements implemented.
